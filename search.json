    "text": "I’ve been grinding Leetcode for some time. Medium and easy problems are not challenging anymore and my focus now is hard.\nThe reasons these problems are hard are from three aspects: 1. The underlying data structure, 2. The scenarios that the data structure needs to be updated, 3. The updating rule.\nThe correct way of dismantling the problem is crucial. A wrong way of approaching the problems won’t give you a solution\nsatisfies all three aspects. The direction for medium and easy problems are obvious while hards are mostly vague.\nMy methodology to solve the hards is as follows: 1. Poke the problem with brutal-force or come up with a top-level direction 2. Test the chosen direction in terms of the three aspects 3. If something doesn’t come together, likely the direction is wrong and a new way of approaching is needed.\nDoing Leetcode hard is fun but very time-consuming. A problem can easily take several hours. Base on current situation, I will shift my priority to learning new tools, limiting at most two hard problems a week."

    "title": "First Blog - How I got here",
    "section": "",
    "text": "By how I got here, I mean what tools I used to set up this web blog.\nThe tool chain includes quarto, github and the underlying git protocol. When I analyze the tool chain, I like to consider how data flows through them. Here is an illustration.\n\nQuarto is an building tool that transforms plain text to HTML and can help with building a simple web site like blog. This process is very similar to compiling. That’s probably why words like “render” and “build” are all over quarto documentation. This “building” or “rendering” can happen in local or remote, so I tried them both for better understanding.\nInstead of version control, Git is mainly for local and remote synchronization. Github is responsible for deploying the blog. It offers a html building library which is not used in my case.\nSetting it all up isn’t as smooth as expected, and makes me wonder what’s the principle of utilizing existing tools. I think of three things: dependency, entry point, and detour. I will discuss these in a later blog.\nOverall, I am not completely satisfied with the automation. My vision was that manual operation is limited to editing the text in an editor. Now I still need to do a bit extra such as creating a folder for each blog. I might update this tool chain in the future."
